        <h1>Etokys Player's Guide</h1>
        Welcome to the Etokys Player's Guide! <br /> <br />
        This supplement offers a variety of optional content for DMs and players alike to incorporate into their world.
        This is intended to be overall compatible with both pre- and post-2024 remaster rulesets. As such, some features may only work as intended for one particular version; these differences are noted within the features, which should hopefully make things a bit easier to follow!
        You may also find some lore here about the world of Etokys; feel free to use it in your own games if you wish, or derive from it and spin your own stories! Etokys is a unique fantasy world developed for my own games, and it has been developed specifically to allow for easy
        incorporation of any and all of the content found here.<br /><br />
        <i>Please note that all content here is homebrewed content made by me; this is unofficial and fanmade, so it may not be available at every table. Further, I have not used AI to generate ideas or game mechanics, and I never will. All content displayed here is proudly human-made.</i><br /><br />
        If you would like to view the content as a whole, you may find the pdf <a href="EtokysPlayersGuide.pdf">here</a> (link coming soon!). Otherwise, you can navigate the various sections in smaller pieces down below. <br /><br />
        Lastly, I would just like to say thank you to anyone reading this, and especially for those who have supported me through the development of this supplement. Your excitement and support helped keep me motivated and brewing.
        While I cannot guarantee I will continue creating content for DND in the future, if you would like to support me, whether as compensation for all the hours put into this or just to help me keep making fun stuff in the future, you can donate to me <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=QXUCWUBVK7X62&no_recurring=1&item_name=You+really+don%27t+have+to%2C+though...&currency_code=USD">here</a>.<br />

                <h3>Small site update and content drop! (11/23/2025)</h3>
                Pushed a small update to the website to make things a bit less cluttered. Mostly creating options to lower the amount of clutter on-screen. Still learning some basic web development skills, so pardon the dust! <br />
                Also added a few small bits of content:
                <ul>
                    <li>Reworked the Expanded Familiar Rules section and added a new section for Additional Creatures; the stat blocks of the new familiars, as well as some basic information about them, is now located there.</li>
                    <li>Added information about the malacostra to the Additional Creatures section and unredacted its presence in the Familiar Rules.</li>
                    <li>Slightly buffed the Pest Slime, as I didn't realize I never added the buffs from my notes to its stat block.</li>
                    <li>Gave some small buffs to the Otarii to be in-line with core D&D rules I had <i>no</i> idea existed, as well as to make them match their lore in some places where they fell short.</li>
                    <li>Made a slight tweak to some wording in Gravity Magnus; functionally, it is identical. It just needed a small clarification about how one feature worked.</li>
                    <li>Added the Light Magnus subclass.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Another small update! (11/14/2025)</h3>
                Just pushing a few small updates to some variant rules. Also made some small adjustments to Magnus (should be functionally basically the same) and added a few more Magnus subclasses.
                <h3>Small update! (11/1/2025)</h3>
                Just added the donation link (it might be janky, I've never done this before). As thanks for the support, I've also dropped a WIP of the Magnus class with just one of the subclasses as a sample. I appreciate your support!
                <h3>Patch two is out! (10/21/2025)</h3>
                (Oh dang, work slowed way down on this project. Sorry!) <br />
                I did some balance passes and formatting fixes on a handful of features and on the site itself, as you may have noticed. I'm also shifting to more of a "release content in smaller batches" schedule,
                rather than trying to cram everything into one big release later on. I appreciate everyone's patience while I continue working!
                <ul>
                    <li>Took a pass at Biomancer, primarily updating features for formatting adjustments and a few small changes to some Blood Rites.</li>
                    <li>Updated the Chemist feat to use Alchemical Tools instead of Brewer's Tools. I somehow missed that those tools existed, so I have corrected the feat to use the right tools for the job.</li>
                    <li>Cleaned up the wording on the Returning weapon property to make it RAW that ranged weapons with this property have their <i>ammunition</i> returned by the property, rather than the weapon itself.</li>
                    <li>All three fighting styles recieved adjustments to make them easier to understand, to account for unexpected interactions, or to make them function as intended.</li>
                    <li>Arsenal Fighter now correctly lists the damage type for using a shield; of all the places I have written shield-based offensive features, this was the only one missing a damage type. (There may be other changes to this subclass I do not remember making currently, but they would most likely just be to fix wording/formatting issues.)</li>
                    <li>Speaking of shields, updated the Shield Warrior feat for easier reading. Idk what tbh, I don't see any big differences--it was probably just something I changed while scrolling by because I thought the old one sounded stiff or something.</li>
                    <li>Adjusted the Combat Specialist feat to properly reference the Magnus Class DC... which really doesn't matter, since the Magnus isn't out yet and you have no Combat Specialization feature to reference yet. Oops.</li>
                    <li>Fixed some formatting inconsistencies in the Spells section.</li>
                    <li>Now for some new stuff! (Not much tbh tho) Added a new 1st-level spell based around bending luck--kind of like Silvery Barbs, but more specific in its use cases.</li>
                    <li>More exciting tho, added the new Bard subclass, the College of Music! If you want your Bard to <i>really</i> like music, to the point of their spellcasting suffering--well, have I got a subclass for you.</li>
                    <li>Added a new miscellaneous option that allows for small tweaks during the character creation process.</li>
                    <li>And possibly more! My notes are a mess and I may have missed something <i>else.</i></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Hotfix implemented! (09/27/2025)</h3>
                Howdy y'all! While taking a look through some of the released content, I noticed a few issues that needed addressing, so things might not be the same as you remember them! <br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Arcane Bulwark's missing material component has been added.</li>
                    <li>Spontaneity Bard can no longer upcast beyond 9th level, as was always the intention.</li>
                    <li>Draconic Warlock spells no longer count against your known spells, which was always the intended functionality.</li>
                    <li>Cursed Clerics had some leftover text from its brainstorming days, somehow; that's now been removed.</li>
                    <li>The kitsune stat block was missing a feature or two I'd somehow neglected to add; I also took the chance to tone down its damage a little, as it seemed a little higher than it should be.</li>
                </ul>
